                The story of this game was very interesting, the combat was fun and didn't get super repetitive because of all the different weapons you can use in the game. 
                The combat to me had the perfect amount of difficulty to make it enjoyable. I love the mix of humor and the serious tone that went along with the setting of the 
                game, and I genuinely enjoyed every mission I played in this game. The rating would be higher if not for the difficulty of actually getting the game to work on 
                my setup, I had to go into the game files for multiple different things and I had to unplug my second monitor just so the game would run correctly on my main 
                monitor. Overall I would definitely recommend people play this game if they enjoy first person games or just story games in general.

                The story of this game to me was kind of difficult to understand, you have to really put things together in your own head to understand what's going on and even
                after beating it I still have a lot of questions on what exactly was going on. The combat in this game was basic, the best part about it was that there are a
                lot of different weapons to use, but each melee weapon was pretty much the same other than damage and the speed at which you swung the weapon. I do really like
                the survival aspect of this game, the parts where you have to find a way to keep yourself hydrated and to not get hungry and to find somewhere where you can 
                sleep through the night. I did really like exploring all of the cave systems throughout the map, and I like that to complete the story you basically have to 
                explore every cave all the way through. The best part about this game is definitely the horror aspect, in every cave and at night it is so dark. Overall, I definitely 
                would recommend this game if you enjoy horror games or survival games.

                This is one of the best multiplayer games I have played in a long time. I was very hesitant to buy this game originally, but I had the itch to play a multiplayer game
                and this was one of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam so I went ahead and bought it. I had never played an extraction shooter before so that aspect of the game 
                was new to me, but I learned the combat decently fast and enjoy it a lot. One of the best parts about this game is that it is fantastic to play by yourself and even better 
                to play with friends. The voice chat that allows you to speak to every other person in the lobby is great for talking trash or negotiating. Overall, I would 100% recommend 
                this game for anyone looking for an online multiplayer experience.
